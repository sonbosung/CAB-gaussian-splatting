## What You Need to Do Before Pushing

### 1. Add Base 3DGS Dependencies (REQUIRED)

The following directories from the original 3D Gaussian Splatting need to be added:

```bash
cd /mnt/disk2/auggs/CAB-gaussian-splatting

# Clone original 3DGS
git clone https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting.git thirdparty/gaussian-splatting

# Copy required directories
cp -r thirdparty/gaussian-splatting/scene .
cp -r thirdparty/gaussian-splatting/gaussian_renderer .
cp -r thirdparty/gaussian-splatting/arguments .

# Add to git
git add scene/ gaussian_renderer/ arguments/ thirdparty/
git commit -m "Add base 3D Gaussian Splatting dependencies"
```

### 2. Set Up GitHub Remote and Push

```bash
cd /mnt/disk2/auggs/CAB-gaussian-splatting

# Add remote (if not already done)
git remote add origin https://github.com/sonbosung/CAB-gaussian-splatting.git

# Rename branch to main (optional)
git branch -M main

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Configure GitHub Repository Settings

On GitHub.com:
- ✅ Add repository description: "SfM Point Augmentation with Scene Co-visibility-based Image Batching for Sharper 3D Gaussian Splatting"
- ✅ Add topics/tags: `3d-gaussian-splatting`, `computer-vision`, `neural-rendering`, `structure-from-motion`, `pytorch`
- ✅ Set license: Custom (as per LICENSE.md)
- ✅ Enable issues for user support
- ✅ Add README.md preview

### 4. Optional Enhancements

**GitHub Actions** (for CI/CD):
- Add workflow for testing imports
- Add workflow for building documentation

**Pre-trained Models**:
- Upload pre-trained models to releases
- Add download links to README

**Example Data**:
- Provide small example scene
- Add to releases or external hosting

## Key Changes Made to Your Files

### Fixed Import Paths
- ✅ `utils/scheduler_utils.py` - Removed hardcoded `/mnt/disk2/auggs/gaussian-splatting` path
- ✅ `utils/colmap_utils.py` - Changed from `colmap.scripts.python` to `utils.read_write_model`
- ✅ `utils/aug_utils.py` - Changed from `colmap.scripts.python` to `utils.read_write_model`
- ✅ `utils/bundle_utils.py` - Changed from `colmap.scripts.python` to `utils.read_write_model`

### Updated Configuration
- ✅ `eval_covis_augment_partialscheduler.sh` - Changed hardcoded paths to environment variables
